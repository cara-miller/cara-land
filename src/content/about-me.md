I do user & industry research to validate product ideas.  
I iterate on designs.  
I code solutions.

I dig the renaissance notion that to be fully human we should try to embrace all knowledge and develop our capacities as much as possible.

Before moving into Technology, I managed an ecommerce design company in the Gift industry. I loved collaborating with creative entrepreneurs to bring their visions to life.

Outside of frowning at my laptop, hobbies include: reading YA fantasy, experimenting in the kitchen, and travelling the world.
